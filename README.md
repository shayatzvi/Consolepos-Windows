# How to install the ConsolePos-windows
## Download and install the software
You must download the ZIP file from this repo, or from my website. If you get it from anywhere else, be advised not to click those links.
Once you have downloaded the file, extract it into the directory you find the safest, because the software will not work if those files do not exist.
Once extracted, click on the EXE file, and it will open the terminal application. Please wait up to a max of 20 seconds until the console loads.
PLEASE NOTE:
On first launch of the application, it will ask if you trust this software creator. If you trust in me, just click on more options, and run anyway.
If you don't trust me, we've got problems.

And you've installed it!
# Some things to note:
If you pin it to your taskbar, it will just open the plain terminal, and not the app within that terminal. I reccomend that you make a shortcut to the EXE file on your desktop, so it is easy to access. 

## DO NOT MOVE A FILE OUT OF THE DIRECTORY, BUT INSTEAD, MOVE THE ENTIRE DIRECTORY ITSELF. 
This is why we recomend that you only make a SHORTCUT and do not move/copy-n-paste the EXE itself out of the directory.
If you copy the file into a different directory, the app will not function correctly.

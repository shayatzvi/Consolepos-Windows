# How to install the ConsolePos-windows
###You may need to install the latest .NET runtime to run this application. It is small and easy to install on windows, linux, and mac. We recomend installing the 9 version of .NET [Click here to download .NET runtime for your OS](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)
## Download and install the software
[Click here to download the ZIP](https://github.com/shayatzvi/Consolepos-Windows/archive/refs/tags/master-not-a-branch.zip)
You must download the ZIP file from this repo, or from my website. If you get it from anywhere else, be advised not to click those links.
Once you have downloaded the file, extract it into the directory you find the safest, because the software will not work if those files do not exist.
Once extracted, click on the EXE file, and it will open the terminal application. Please wait up to a max of 20 seconds until the console loads.
PLEASE NOTE:
On first launch of the application, it will ask if you trust this software creator. If you trust in me, just click on more options, and run anyway.
If you don't trust me, we've got problems.

And you've installed it!
# Some things to note:
If you pin it to your taskbar, it will just open the plain terminal, and not the app within that terminal. I reccomend that you make a shortcut to the EXE file on your desktop, so it is easy to access. 
# Update the software
Updating the software without losing all data is a bit tricky, but I will guide you on how.
First, copy all of the files such as customers, products, reciepts, with the JSON extension, into somewhere where you can find it later. Next, delete the old folder with the app in it. 
Then, download the new version. Once you have downloaded it, extract it, find the files you put away earlier and paste those into the new folder. If it asks you about replacing, removing, files in that directory, just enter, replace the file. This entire shpiel should work.
## DO NOT MOVE A FILE OUT OF THE DIRECTORY, BUT INSTEAD, MOVE THE ENTIRE DIRECTORY ITSELF. 
This is why we recomend that you only make a SHORTCUT and do not move/copy-n-paste the EXE itself out of the directory.
If you copy the file into a different directory, the app will not function correctly.
